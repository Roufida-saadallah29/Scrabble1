# Scrabble1
is a console application game which  two to four players score points by placing tiles, each bearing a single letter, onto a game board divided into a 15Ã—15 grid of squares. 
The tiles must form words that, in crossword fashion, read left to right in rows or downward in columns, and be included in a standard dictionary or lexicon.
